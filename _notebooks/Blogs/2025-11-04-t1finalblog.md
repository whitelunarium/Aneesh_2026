<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:2.5em; color:#00bfff; margin-bottom:0.5em;">🌌 Reflecting on Trimester 1: My Journey Through CSP</h1>

<p style="font-size:1.1em; line-height:1.8;">
As Trimester 1 comes to an end, I can look back and see how much I've grown—not just as a coder, but as a problem solver, designer, and creator. When I began CSP, I expected to simply write lines of code. What I didn’t expect was how deeply creativity, collaboration, and persistence would shape my learning.
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.1em; line-height:1.8;">
From debugging JavaScript logic at midnight to watching my RPG game finally come alive, each project taught me something new. Whether it was learning to control sprites, building my Jekyll site from scratch, or figuring out why something *just wouldn’t work*, I learned that computer science is equal parts logic and imagination.

<h2 style="color:#00ff99;">🚀 Highlights of My Trimester</h2>

<ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0;">
  <li style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">🧩 <b>RPG Game Development:</b> Created a sprite-based maze game with JavaScript—seeing it actually work felt amazing.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">🌐 <b>Nighthawk Pages:</b> Built and customized my own website using Jekyll and Markdown themes.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">⚙️ <b>Debugging & Problem Solving:</b> Learned how every bug is just another mystery waiting to be solved.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">💡 <b>Creativity Meets Logic:</b> Discovered how coding is both analytical and artistic.</li>
</ul>

  <h3 style="margin-top:0; color:#00bfff;">💭 Lessons Learned</h3>
  <p style="margin:0; font-size:1.05em; line-height:1.6;">
  The biggest takeaway from this trimester is that progress comes from persistence. Coding doesn’t always work on the first try, but when it finally clicks, it’s one of the best feelings in the world.

<h2 style="color:#00ff99; margin-top:2.5rem;">🎯 Looking Ahead</h2>

<p style="font-size:1.1em; line-height:1.8;">
Next trimester, I want to take what I’ve learned and push further—cleaner code, smoother design, and even more creativity. CSP showed me that coding isn’t just about syntax; it’s about turning imagination into something real.
