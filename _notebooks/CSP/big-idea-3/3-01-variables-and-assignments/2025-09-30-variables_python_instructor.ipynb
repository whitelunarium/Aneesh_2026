    "\n",
    "**Lesson Goal:**\n",
    "- Understand how Python variables and assignments work, and how they compare to JavaScript.\n",
    "- Work with and understand how to initialize and assign data to Python objects, just like you did with JavaScript objects.\n",
    "- See how Python's approach to variables, types, and objects is similar to and different from JavaScript.\n",

    "**Why connect JavaScript and Python?**\n",
    "If you already know JavaScript, learning Python is easier when you see the parallels. Both languages use variables, data types, and objects, but the syntax and some behaviors are different. This lesson will help you bridge your knowledge and become a more versatile programmer."

    "## Primitive and Reference Data Types: Python vs JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like JavaScript, Python has two main categories of data types: **primitive types** (which store simple values directly) and **reference types** (which store references to more complex data).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**In JavaScript:** You learned about `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Undefined`, `Null`, `Symbol`, and `BigInt` as primitive types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Python:** The most common primitive types are:\n",
    "- `int` (integer numbers, like `42`)\n",
    "- `float` (decimal numbers, like `3.14`)\n",
    "- `str` (strings, like `'hello'`)\n",
    "- `bool` (Boolean values: `True` or `False`)\n",
    "- `NoneType` (the special value `None`, similar to JavaScript's `null`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not have `undefined`, `symbol`, or `bigint` types, but the core idea is the same: these types hold simple, single values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**In JavaScript:** You used `Object`, `Array`, and `Function` as reference types. These store references (links) to more complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Python:** The most common reference types are:\n",
    "- `list` (like JavaScript arrays: `[1, 2, 3]`)\n",
    "- `dict` (like JavaScript objects: `{'name': 'Mario', 'score': 0}`)\n",
    "- `set` (a collection of unique values: `{'apple', 'banana'}`)\n",
    "- `function` (functions are also objects in Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you assign a reference type in Python, you are assigning a reference (a link) to the object, not a copy of the objectâ€”just like in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this matter?**\n",
    "Understanding the difference between primitive and reference types helps you predict how variables behave when you assign, copy, or modify them. This is a key skill for debugging and writing reliable code in both Python and JavaScript."
