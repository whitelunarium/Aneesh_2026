    "\n",
    "> An API is like a football team:  \n",
    "> * The **playbook** is the API — it tells you what plays you can run.  \n",
    "> * You can request a **play** (order).  \n",
    "> * The **quarterback** (server) confirms the play.  \n",
    "> * The **coach** (API) delivers the play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program can **request**, **filter**, **compare**, and **update** real-time sports data to create dynamic dashboards—just like professional analytics teams."
