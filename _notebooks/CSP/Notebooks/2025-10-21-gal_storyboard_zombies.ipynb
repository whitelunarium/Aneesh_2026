    "**Sports World: The Algorithm Arena**\n",
    "Exploring how APIs bring sports statistics and stadium data to life through performance, logic, and visualization.\n",

    "### Our Route\n",

    "San Diego → Los Angeles → San Francisco → Seattle\n",

    "### Stop 1: San Diego — “Connecting to the Data Field”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus:** Petco Park (Baseball – Padres) and Snapdragon Stadium (Soccer – SDFC)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Concept:** API Handling — GET and POST Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activity:**\n",
    "Use APIs to collect **team and stadium data**, such as scores, ticket prices, fan attendance, or upcoming schedules.\n",
    "Display the retrieved data in a basic dashboard or simple app interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning:**\n",
    "APIs act like scouts—fetching live data from multiple sources and delivering it to your program in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stop 2: Los Angeles — “Filtering the Playbook”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus:** Intuit Dome (Basketball – Clippers) and SoFi Stadium (Football – Chargers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Concept:** Sorting and Filtering API Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activity:**\n",
    "Use the same API endpoints but apply filters—for example, retrieving only home game stats, specific dates, or player performance metrics.\n",
    "Represent filtered results through clear visuals such as tables or bar charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning:**\n",
    "Just as analysts focus on key plays or specific matchups, coders use filtering and sorting logic to extract the most relevant information from an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stop 3: San Francisco — “Analyzing Performance Data”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus:** Chase Center (Basketball – Warriors) and Levi’s Stadium (Football – 49ers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Concept:** Combining and Comparing API Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activity:**\n",
    "Call multiple APIs to collect **both team and stadium data**, then merge and compare the results.\n",
    "Visualize relationships—such as average attendance vs. win rate, or home vs. away performance—using charts or graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning:**\n",
    "By combining datasets, programmers uncover meaningful patterns—just as coaches use layered statistics to make smarter strategic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stop 4: Seattle — “Updating the Leaderboard”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus:** Lumen Field (Football – Seahawks) and T-Mobile Park (Baseball – Mariners)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Concept:** Fetching and Updating Data with API Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activity:**\n",
    "Build logic for updating or posting new information, such as adding match results, editing player stats, or recalculating averages.\n",
    "Show these updates dynamically in a live leaderboard or summary dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning:**\n",
    "APIs don’t just read data—they also let you write and update it, keeping your applications as current as the live game feed.\n",

    "\n",
    "An API is like a restaurant service system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You (the user) want to order food.\n",
    "* The **menu** is like the API — it tells you what’s available.\n",
    "* You give your **request** to the waiter (the program).\n",
    "* The waiter goes to the **kitchen** (the server) and returns your **food** (the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, your code can **request data** from an API (like team stats or ticket prices) and use it to **build visualizations, comparisons, and insights** for your sports dashboard.\n",
