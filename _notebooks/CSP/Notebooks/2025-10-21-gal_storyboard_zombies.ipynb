    "### Stop 1: San Diego — “Connecting to the Data Field”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus:** Petco Park (Baseball – Padres) and Snapdragon Stadium (Soccer – SDFC)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Concept:** API Handling — GET and POST Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activity:**\n",
    "Use APIs to collect **team and stadium data**, such as scores, ticket prices, fan attendance, or upcoming schedules.\n",
    "Display the retrieved data in a simple interface or dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning:**\n",
    "APIs act like scouts—fetching live data from multiple sources and delivering it to your program in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stop 2: Los Angeles — “Filtering the Playbook”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus:** Dodger Stadium (Baseball – Dodgers) and SoFi Stadium (Football – Chargers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Concept:** Sorting and Filtering API Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activity:**\n",
    "Query the same API endpoints but apply filters—for example, retrieve only home game stats, specific dates, or certain player records.\n",
    "Visualize how filtering reveals deeper performance insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning:**\n",
    "Just as analysts focus on key plays or metrics, coders use filtering logic to extract the most relevant information from an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stop 3: San Francisco — “Analyzing Performance Data”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus:** Chase Center (Basketball – Warriors) and Oracle Park (Baseball – Giants)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Concept:** Combining and Comparing API Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activity:**\n",
    "Use multiple API calls to pull **both team and stadium stats**, then merge or compare the data sets.\n",
    "Create charts that show relationships—like average attendance vs. win rate or home vs. away performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning:**\n",
    "By combining datasets, programmers uncover patterns—just as coaches use statistics to analyze performance trends.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Stop 4: Seattle — “Updating the Leaderboard”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus:** Lumen Field (Football – Seahawks) and T-Mobile Park (Baseball – Mariners)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Concept:** Fetching and Updating Data with API Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activity:**\n",
    "Build logic for updating or posting new information, such as editing records, adding new match results, or recalculating averages.\n",
    "Reflect updates in a dynamic leaderboard or summary dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning:**\n",
    "APIs don’t just read data—they let you write and update it, keeping your application as current as the live game feed.\n",
