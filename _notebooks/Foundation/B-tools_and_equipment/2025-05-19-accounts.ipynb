    "<!-- ## Personal Identifiable Information (PII)\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating accounts for this course, it's important to understand what personal identifiable information (PII) is and how and what to protect. PII includes any information that can be used to identify you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, in some cases we will ask you share or build the value PII.  We hope to do it in a good way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why PII Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Websites like `LinkedIn` are places where we want to showcase our accomplishments. We intend to advertise PII.\n",
    "\n",
    "As individuals and a society, sometimes we are willing spread our PII through sites like TikTok, Reddit, X, Instagram or Facebook. This often provides satisfaction, some refer to it as the dopamine effect.  Sometimes we are proud of what we advertise, sometime us or others wish they could retract the information shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our society, all the accounts mentioned above become part of our PII.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/accounts.png\" alt=\"Reading image\" style=\"width:50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of PII\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Public Information**: These are details that are generally known and shared:\n",
    "  - Name\n",
    "  - Email (consider using a secondary email)\n",
    "  - Picture\n",
    "  - High School and College attended\n",
    "  - Properties you own\n",
    "  - State and City of residence\n",
    "  - Previous residences\n",
    "  - Credit Reports\n",
    "  - Home router location\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sensitive Information**: Be more cautious with these details:\n",
    "  - Full birth date\n",
    "  - Place of Birth\n",
    "  - Street Address\n",
    "  - Phone Number\n",
    "  - Maiden names of Mother or Grandmother\n",
    "  - Driver's License Number\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Highly Confidential Information**: Keep these absolutely secret:\n",
    "  - Internet Access Credentials\n",
    "  - Google key store\n",
    "  - Two-Factor Authentication sources\n",
    "  - Social Security Number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques to Increase Security\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Use systems that require a code sent to your phone or email.\n",
    "* **Biometrics**: Secure your devices with fingerprints or facial recognition.\n",
    "* **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Understand that public-key cryptography uses a pair of keys (one public, one private) to encrypt and decrypt messages. This is used in SSL for secure websites (aka https://).\n",
    "* **Strong Passwords**: Use complex and unique passwords for different accounts. Consider using a password manager to keep track of them.\n",
    "* **Regular Software Updates**: Keep your operating system, applications, and antivirus software up to date to protect against the latest threats.\n",
    "* **Secure Home Router**: Create a strong password for your home router to ensure it is not easily compromised from the internet.\n",
    "* **Secure Wi-Fi**: Use strong passwords for your home Wi-Fi network to ensure it is not easily accessed by others in proximity (e.g., the stree). Consider using a VPN when accessing Wi-Fi in public places (e.g., coffee shops).\n",
    "* **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data on your devices and backups to protect it from unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Be Aware of Internet Threats\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Viruses and Malware**: These compromise security and are often spread through email attachments.\n",
    "* **Phishing**: Be cautious of attempts to get your information through deceptive emails or websites.\n",
    "* **Social Engineering**: Be aware of tactics used to manipulate you into divulging confidential information.\n",
    "* **Post-Incident Actions**: If compromised, review and secure all vulnerabilities immediately. Revise and update your PII plan to prevent future incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding and protecting your PII, you can safely navigate the digital world and keep sensitive and highly confidentail personal information secure. -->\n"

    "## PII Strategy on Account Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is in the your interest that you establish and continually refine your PII (Personal Identifiable Information) strategy. It is likely that you are already active in sharing common PII, considering for yourself what is OK to share. As you progress in the digital world, you will likely need to adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Categorize Information**: \n",
    "   - **Public Information**: Information you are comfortable sharing publicly, such as your name and general interests.\n",
    "     <img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/tools/information.jpg\" alt=\"Multi-Factor-Authentication\" style=\"width:25%; min-width:120px; border-radius: 12px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Sensitive Information**: Information that should be shared cautiously, such as your full birth date and phone number.\n",
    "     <img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/tools/something.png\" alt=\"Multi-Factor-Authentication\" style=\"width:50%; min-width:120px; border-radius: 24px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Highly Confidential Information**: Information that should be kept strictly private, like social security number and internet access credentials.\n",
    "     <img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/tools/confidential.jpeg\" alt=\"Multi-Factor-Authentication\" style=\"width:40%; min-width:120px; border-radius: 12px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Different Email Accounts**: \n",
    "   - Maintain different email accounts for different purposes (e.g., junk email, common email, work/school email, important email). This helps manage the type and volume of information you receive and sets expectations for the importance of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Be Prepared for Security Incidents**: \n",
    "   - Anticipate that you may be hacked and will need to secure any vulnerabilities. Regularly update your passwords and use multi-factor authentication where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adapt and Evolve**: \n",
    "   - As you gain more experience and your digital footprint grows, continually reassess and adapt your PII strategy to ensure it remains effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parting Advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "Be cautious with the information you share online. Protect your personal data by using separate email accounts, staying aware of security risks, and adapting your practices as the digital world evolves. Taking steps now helps safeguard your digital identity in the future."
